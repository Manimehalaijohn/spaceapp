  <h2>SWOT Mission</h2>

  <p>The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission is a joint venture between NASA and CNES (the French Space Agency). It aims to provide high-resolution observations of Earth's surface water and its elevation, enabling better understanding and monitoring of the ocean and freshwater bodies such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands.</p>
  <p>Interesting fact: SWOT will be the first mission to provide global, high-resolution observations of Earth's surface water, allowing scientists to study how water bodies change over time and function in Earth's water cycle.</p>

  <h2>GRACE Mission</h2>

  <p>The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission was a joint project between NASA and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). It involved two satellites, GRACE-1 and GRACE-2, which tracked changes in Earth's gravity field to monitor variations in Earth's water resources, ice sheets, and climate.</p>
  <p>Interesting fact: The GRACE mission discovered that Earth's ice sheets, such as those in Greenland and Antarctica, are losing mass at an accelerating rate, contributing to sea-level rise.</p>
  <p>To find detailed information about the GRACE mission, you can visit the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/gravity-recovery-and-climate-experiment-grace">GRACE mission page</a> on the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) website.</p>
